Demonstrate image classification using machine learning

## What is this repo?
I used [teachable machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
to train a machine learning model to classify images as cats or dogs.
The slideshow gives an overview of the process.

There is a python script in the `code` directory which can run the models
created using teachable machine, which have been exported to the keras format.
